# ECM Service Level Objectives

**Status:** Initial scaffold (v1). Targets are conservative and MUST be recalibrated against 30+ days of production metrics before being treated as commitments.
**Owner:** SRE persona.
**Baseline:** Built on the observability substrate shipped in [PR #80](https://github.com/MotWakorb/enhancedchannelmanager/pull/80) (bd-ak1db). The four `ecm_*` series exposed on `/metrics` are the foundation for every SLI below.
**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 (bd-dl1bd).

## Why this exists

The observability baseline gave ECM *signal*: we can see request rate, latency distributions, error rate, and readiness state on a Prometheus-compatible endpoint. Signal without thresholds is not reliability — it's just telemetry. This document turns signal into **commitments**: what "good" looks like, how much bad we tolerate (error budget), and what we do when the budget burns.

Without SLOs, on-call has no objective criterion for paging. "The app feels slow" is not an incident; "p95 latency breached 500ms for 10 minutes, consuming 15% of the weekly error budget" is. This document exists so that answer is computable, not negotiated.

## Definitions

- **SLI — Service Level Indicator.** The raw metric we measure (e.g., ratio of successful readiness probes to total probes).
- **SLO — Service Level Objective.** The target we commit to for an SLI over a rolling window (e.g., 99% over 30 days).
- **Error budget.** `1 - SLO`. The amount of failure we can absorb without breaching the commitment. For a 99% / 30d SLO, the budget is 1% of 30 days = ~7.2 hours of downtime per 30 days.
- **Burn rate.** Current rate of budget consumption relative to the steady-state burn that would exhaust the budget exactly at window close. A burn rate of 1.0 means we're consuming budget at exactly the rate the SLO allows; 14.4 means we'd exhaust a 30-day budget in ~2 days.

## Scope

These SLOs apply to the `ecm` FastAPI backend (`ecm-ecm-1` container) serving `/api/*` and `/api/health/*` endpoints on the port configured by the container. The `/metrics` endpoint itself is **excluded** from all SLO calculations — the HTTP middleware self-skips it (see `backend/main.py:255`), and it must not influence availability or latency numbers.

Out of scope for v1:

- Frontend asset delivery (served statically; different failure mode).
- WebSocket long-lived connections (`/ws/*` — no histogram coverage yet).
- Background task success rate (task scheduler has no `ecm_task_*` metrics yet — separate bead when we instrument it).

## SLO-1: Readiness Availability

**SLI:** Fraction of readiness probes that report `ecm_health_ready_ok == 1`, measured as the time-weighted average of the gauge over the window.

**Prometheus expression (SLI numerator over denominator):**
```promql
avg_over_time(ecm_health_ready_ok[30d])
```

**SLO target:** **99.0%** over a rolling 30-day window.

**Error budget:** 1% = ~7h 12m of `ecm_health_ready_ok == 0` per 30d.

**Why this target (initial):** 99.0% is a deliberately conservative starting point. Mature SaaS SLOs for readiness sit at 99.9% (~43 min/month) or higher, but:

1. ECM is a self-hosted LAN app that frequently runs on consumer hardware with non-trivial restart windows (container updates, host reboots, power events). A three-nines commitment would be ambitious without redundancy we haven't built.
2. The readiness probe includes a Dispatcharr dependency — ECM's availability is bounded above by Dispatcharr's availability, which is outside our control.
3. We have **zero days** of real production metrics at the time of writing. The target must be calibrated against observed behavior before tightening.

Re-tune after 30 days of production data. If we sustain 99.9% comfortably, tighten to 99.5%; revisit every quarter.

**What breaks this SLO:**

- Database file lock contention (`/config/journal.db` under heavy auto-creation load).
- Dispatcharr unreachable (network partition, Dispatcharr restart, bad credentials).
- ffprobe binary missing or permissions broken (degrades but does not fail readiness — see `routers/health.py` skip-vs-fail semantics).

## SLO-2: HTTP Request Latency

**SLI:** 95th percentile request latency over `ecm_http_request_duration_seconds`, across all methods and route patterns (excluding `/metrics` and `/api/health/*` — those are instrumented separately and have different SLOs).

**Prometheus expression:**
```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le) (
    rate(ecm_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{path!~"/metrics|/api/health/.*"}[5m])
  )
)
```

**SLO target:** **p95 < 500ms** over rolling 5-minute windows, for at least **99%** of those windows over 30 days.

**Error budget:** 1% of 30d * 5m windows = ~86 minutes of windows where p95 ≥ 500ms per 30d.

**Why this target (initial):** The latency histogram buckets ak1db shipped (`0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0`) were tuned for "local web app hitting SQLite + LAN Dispatcharr" where most requests land under 100ms. A 500ms p95 ceiling gives comfortable headroom: if we breach it routinely, we've got a real slowdown worth investigating. This bucket layout also means `histogram_quantile` interpolation is reasonable around the 500ms boundary — the 0.25 and 0.5 buckets straddle it cleanly.

Tighten to p95 < 250ms once we have baseline data showing we comfortably beat 500ms.

**What breaks this SLO:**

- SQLite write amplification during bulk auto-creation (lots of small transactions).
- Dispatcharr API slowness (ECM proxies many requests).
- N+1 query patterns in frontends (often the real culprit — a single user view hitting `/api/channels/*` 500 times serially).

**Runbook:** [`docs/runbooks/http_latency.md`](../runbooks/http_latency.md)

## SLO-3: HTTP Error Rate

**SLI:** Ratio of HTTP 5xx responses to total responses, across all routes (excluding `/metrics` which is self-skipped by the middleware).

**Prometheus expression:**
```promql
sum(rate(ecm_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(ecm_http_requests_total[5m]))
```

**SLO target:** **5xx error rate < 1%** over rolling 5-minute windows, for **99%** of windows over 30 days.

**Error budget:** Same as SLO-2 structurally — ~86 minutes of > 1% 5xx windows per 30d.

**Why this target (initial):** 1% is intentionally loose for a scaffold. A mature SLO would target 0.1% or tighter, but:

1. Some ECM endpoints wrap Dispatcharr (not our failure mode, but our status code).
2. Auto-creation rules with bad upstream streams will 5xx as designed until the user fixes the rule.
3. We don't yet separate "our bug" 5xxs from "integration partner down" 5xxs.

A follow-up bead should split this SLO by `path` label once we've observed which routes dominate the error budget, and introduce per-route sub-objectives (e.g., `/api/auth/login` should be far stricter than `/api/stream/probe`).

4xx responses are **not** counted — they reflect client behavior, not service reliability. A spike in 401s during a credential-rotation event is correct behavior, not an SLO breach.

**What breaks this SLO:**

- Database session exhaustion / pool timeouts.
- Dispatcharr returning 5xx (we pass through).
- Unhandled exceptions in routers (caught by the OWASP 500-scrubber middleware — still counts as a 5xx for this SLO, which is correct).

**Runbook:** [`docs/runbooks/http_error_rate.md`](../runbooks/http_error_rate.md)

## SLO-4: Readiness Sub-check Latency (informational)

**SLI:** 95th percentile duration of readiness sub-checks, per `check` label (`database`, `dispatcharr`, `ffprobe`).

**Prometheus expression (per check):**
```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le, check) (
    rate(ecm_health_ready_check_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

**SLO target (soft / informational only):**

- `database` sub-check p95 < 50ms
- `dispatcharr` sub-check p95 < 500ms
- `ffprobe` sub-check p95 < 100ms

**Why informational only:** These are diagnostic signals — a slow readiness sub-check is a leading indicator for SLO-1 and SLO-2, but users don't directly experience readiness probe latency. We alert **warning** (not page) on breach so on-call gets situational awareness without being woken up.

**Runbook:** [`docs/runbooks/readiness_subcheck_latency.md`](../runbooks/readiness_subcheck_latency.md)

## Error-budget policy

What happens when the error budget burns? The rules below apply per-SLO; burns are evaluated weekly.

| Budget state | Trigger | Response |
|-|-|-|
| **Healthy** | <25% budget consumed in window | Normal feature work. No action required. |
| **Concerned** | 25–50% consumed | SRE posts weekly status in the sprint channel. No scope change. |
| **Warning** | 50–75% consumed | Reliability work is prioritized in the next sprint grooming. New features not yet started are deferred if they risk further burn. |
| **Critical** | 75–100% consumed | All feature work stops. Incident review. Reliability fixes ship before anything else resumes. |
| **Exhausted** | 100%+ consumed (SLO breached) | Blameless postmortem within 5 business days. Freeze on new deployments except reliability fixes until the budget resets or recovers by ≥10 percentage points. |

**Budget resets** on a rolling basis — the 30-day window always looks at the last 30 days, so a burn today drops out 30 days from now if no new burn occurs.

**Exceptions:** Security fixes always ship regardless of budget state. A zero-day 4pm on Friday doesn't wait for the error budget to heal — but it's tracked and the postmortem captures the reliability cost.

---

## Alerting strategy

Alert rules are defined in [`prometheus_rules.yaml`](./prometheus_rules.yaml). The strategy is multi-window multi-burn-rate (MWMBR) where feasible:

- **Fast burn (page):** If the current burn rate would consume 2% of a 30-day budget in 1 hour (14.4x burn), page immediately. This catches acute incidents.
- **Slow burn (ticket):** If the current burn rate would consume 10% of a 30-day budget in 6 hours (6x burn) sustained, open a ticket / warning alert. This catches chronic degradation.

For the scaffold we ship simpler single-window thresholds for SLO-2/3 (p95 latency breach, 5xx rate breach) because burn-rate alerts on histogram-derived SLIs require recording rules we haven't provisioned. Follow-up bead: add recording rules + multi-window burn-rate alerts once a Prometheus scrape target exists to consume them.

---

## Open questions / known gaps

- **No traffic-weighted availability.** SLO-1 treats every 15-second scrape of `ecm_health_ready_ok` as equal weight, regardless of how many user requests landed during that interval. A future refinement: weight by `ecm_http_requests_total` rate.
- **No per-tenant SLO.** ECM is single-tenant by deployment, but the SLOs above are global — they don't distinguish a power user from a casual one. Fine for v1; revisit if we ship multi-tenant.
- **No Dispatcharr-upstream vs ECM-self attribution.** When `ecm_http_requests_total{status="502"}` fires because Dispatcharr returned 502, it still counts against our SLO. The fix is a separate label or metric, tracked as a follow-up.
- **No SLO for long-running tasks.** Task success rate matters (restore jobs, auto-creation runs) but has no metric today. Separate bead.

## Changelog

- **2026-04-20 (bd-dl1bd):** Initial scaffold. Four SLOs defined, targets conservative, error-budget policy drafted, alert rules shipped in sibling YAML. **Not yet calibrated against real traffic** — targets must be revisited once 30 days of production metrics exist.
