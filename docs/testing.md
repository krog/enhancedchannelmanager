## Coverage ratchet cadence

Coverage is enforced in CI as a **one-way ratchet**: the current floor is the
baseline measured 2026-04-20 during bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`, minus
a small regression buffer. Crossing below those numbers fails the CI job.

### Current thresholds

| Suite | Metric | Measured 2026-04-20 | Threshold | Buffer | Where enforced |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Backend (pytest + coverage.py) | lines | 58% | 56% | 2 pts | `backend/pytest.ini` (`--cov-fail-under=56`), paths in `backend/.coveragerc` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | statements | 15.17% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.statements` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | branches | 14.13% | 12% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.branches` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | functions | 15.28% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.functions` |
| Frontend (vitest + v8) | lines | 15.46% | 13% | 2 pts | `frontend/vitest.config.ts` `thresholds.lines` |

Backend measurement: `docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest
--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow" --cov-config=/tmp/.coveragerc --cov=.
--cov-report=term'` with the three known-drift deselects from the flake
section above. 2427 tests, 3 deselected.

Frontend measurement: `cd frontend && npm run test:coverage`. 1118 tests across
44 files.

### Rationale for buffer choice

The ideal methodology (from bead `enhancedchannelmanager-nmlxi`) is to wait
~1 week after the CI test-gate landed (`enhancedchannelmanager-t8xw3`) so we
can observe real per-PR coverage numbers rather than the full-suite snapshot.
We didn't have that window — t8xw3 closed the day this bead landed. The PO
approved a single full-suite snapshot with a 2-point buffer as a pragmatic
baseline. Expect slightly churny CI on PRs that touch low-coverage modules
until the first re-ratchet.

### Re-ratchet policy

- **Cadence**: review the thresholds **2-4 weeks after this bead lands**,
  once real PR coverage data exists. Thereafter, review quarterly (aligned
  with the flake sweep).
- **Raise criterion**: if every PR merged in the review window held coverage
  comfortably (≥ threshold + 3 points) on every metric, raise that metric's
  threshold by **~5 points**. Never raise by more than 5 points in one
  review — gives authors time to respond before the ratchet tightens further.
- **Lower prohibition**: thresholds are **one-way**. Lowering requires
  explicit PO approval and a one-line rationale in the commit message. Do
  not lower "because my PR didn't quite make it" — add tests instead.
- **Per-metric independence**: frontend has four metrics (lines, branches,
  functions, statements). They ratchet independently. A PR that lifts
  function coverage to 20% should raise the function threshold to 15% —
  it does not have to wait for statements to also move.
- **Scope creep guard**: this bead's predecessor (`t8xw3`) explicitly
  excludes retroactively force-testing low-coverage modules. The ratchet
  exists to prevent regression, not to force a coverage sprint.

### Next-iteration upgrade: diff-coverage

The bead scope flagged **diff-coverage** (coverage of CHANGED lines only)
as a likely better gate for a 61K-line codebase — whole-codebase coverage
is noisy for small PRs. This is out of scope for the current ratchet bead
and should be filed as a follow-up. Candidate tools:

- Python: `diff-cover` (PyPI) integrates cleanly with coverage.xml.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `diff-cover` also consumes v8/lcov output.

When we file the follow-up, the gate becomes "changed lines must hit X%
coverage" with X set conservatively (≥ 80% seems reasonable given the base
rates above) and the whole-codebase thresholds stay as a floor.

### Running coverage locally

```bash
# Backend — inside the container (matches the CI invocation).
docker exec ecm-ecm-1 sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest \
  --ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow" --no-header -p no:warnings'
# Coverage is auto-enabled via pytest.ini addopts. To disable for a quick
# single-file run: add --no-cov.

# Frontend — from the host.
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

If a local run drops below threshold, fix the root cause (add a test, remove
dead code, or adjust .coveragerc omit if the file is genuinely non-runtime).
Do **not** lower the threshold in the config.

## When to Run Tests

- **Backend tests**: MANDATORY for any backend code changes
- **Frontend tests**: MANDATORY for any frontend code changes
- **E2E tests**: Run on merge to main only (CI/CD pipeline)

## Quality Gate Commands

```bash
# Backend
python -m py_compile backend/main.py && cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test && npm run build
```

## Mock Patch Targets

When endpoints move from `main.py` to `routers/<module>.py`, test mock patches must be updated:
- `patch("main.get_client")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_client")`
- `patch("main.get_settings")` → `patch("routers.<module>.get_settings")`
- `patch("main.journal")` → `patch("routers.<module>.journal")`
- Same for `get_session`, `get_prober`, `asyncio`, etc.

## Flake Triage Policy

Flaky tests — tests that pass and fail non-deterministically without code changes
— are treated as **P1 bugs** (per the QA hard rules). The baseline established in
bead `enhancedchannelmanager-tp681` (2026-04-20): 3 consecutive BE + FE runs on
`dev` tip produced zero true flakes.

### What counts as a flake

A test is **flaky** if it changes outcome (pass → fail or fail → pass) across
identical re-runs without any code or data change. Common causes:

- **Timing / ordering**: races, `await asyncio.sleep(...)` assumptions,
  wall-clock comparisons.
- **Shared state**: module-level globals leaking between tests, DB rows not
  rolled back, singleton clients caching values.
- **Environmental**: test expects a file, binary, or network endpoint that is
  only sometimes present. These are **not true flakes** — they are environment
  drift and should be fixed by making the test defensive, not by re-running.

If a test fails identically every run for the same reason, it is **deterministically
broken** — repair the test or the code. Do not mark it `flaky`.

### Re-run policy (CI & local)

| Scenario | Allowed re-runs |
|----------|-----------------|
| PR check fails on one test, passes on re-run | Re-run **once** to confirm flake. If flaky, file a `flaky`-labelled bead before merge. |
| PR check fails on same test twice in a row | Treat as deterministic break — do not merge. |
| Local `pytest` / `vitest` reports intermittent failure | Re-run **up to twice**. If it recurs, open a bead rather than silently re-running. |

**Never** use `pytest-rerunfailures`, `vitest --retry`, or equivalent as an
automatic safety net. Retries hide flakes. They are only acceptable as a
temporary mitigation while a bead is open.

### Marking a test as a known flake

1. File a bead (`bd create enhancedchannelmanager "<test path>: flaky — <symptom>"`)
   and add the `flaky` label.
2. If the test blocks the suite, mark it with
   `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="flaky, see bead <id>")` or
   `test.fixme(...)` in vitest. Cite the bead ID in the reason string.
3. Do **not** leave `@pytest.mark.xfail` on flaky tests — xfail masks real
   regressions once the code is fixed.

### Quarterly flake sweep

Every quarter (tracked via recurring beads), the QA persona (or on-call
engineer in its absence) runs the 3-run cadence from bead `tp681`:

1. Pull the current `flaky`-labelled beads list.
2. Execute BE (`pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow"`) and FE
   (`npx vitest run`) three consecutive times on `dev` tip.
3. Any test that fails in exactly one of the three runs → new `flaky`-labelled
   bead (or comment on the existing one if already known).
4. Any test that fails in all three runs → it is a real regression; escalate
   to a P0/P1 bug bead in the relevant domain.
5. Revisit the open `flaky` bead list and close anything that is now passing
   three runs cleanly without code change.

### Flake baseline gate for PR reviews

The reviewer SHOULD reject a PR when the CI failure signature includes a test
in the **flagged-in-last-30-runs** list — those are known-flaky and the PR
needs a clean re-run (or an explicit note that the flake is unrelated to the
change).

Until automation tracks the 30-run window directly (see follow-up bead), use
this manual process:

1. Pull the list of `flaky`-labelled open beads: `bd list --label flaky`.
2. If the failing test is in that list → re-run once. If still fails →
   investigate; probably unrelated to the PR but do not merge until the next
   CI run is green.
3. If the failing test is **not** in the flaky list → treat as deterministic
   and block the merge until fixed.

### Known baseline flakes (as of 2026-04-20)

**Frontend (vitest):** zero flakes. 1118/1118 tests passed in three consecutive
runs on commit `a35d4f5e`.

**Backend (pytest, `--ignore=tests/e2e -m "not slow"`):** two flaky tests under
`tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware`:
- `test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line`
- `test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs`

Both pass in isolation and fail when run after the second half of
`tests/integration/`. Root cause is contextvar / logging-handler leakage from
an integration test into the observability middleware's capture fixture.
Tracked in bead **enhancedchannelmanager-hhsz0** (`flaky` label, P1).

**Not flakes, but deterministic environment drift (three BE tests):**
- `tests/integration/test_api_tasks.py::TestRunTaskWithSchedule::test_run_task_with_schedule_id`
  — references a POST route that was removed from `routers/tasks.py`.
- `tests/integration/test_router_registration.py::TestRoutePrefixes::test_all_routes_under_api`
  — fails because the SPA fallback route `/{full_path:path}` registers only
    when `backend/static/` exists (present in prod image, absent on CI).
- `tests/unit/test_ffmpeg_execution.py::TestExecutionSafety::test_validates_output_path_writable`
  — the code under test never implements the output-writability check its
    docstring promises.

These pass on CI (`backend/` workdir, no `static/`, stubbed ffmpeg mocks) but
fail in `ecm-ecm-1`. Tracked in bead **enhancedchannelmanager-0gcu9** as
test-authorship repair. Until that bead lands, the container-side 3-run
cadence uses `--deselect` for these three tests.

### Full-suite 3-run cadence command

The exact command used for the `tp681` baseline and the quarterly sweep:

```bash
# BE — from inside ecm-ecm-1
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e \
  --deselect tests/integration/test_api_tasks.py::TestRunTaskWithSchedule::test_run_task_with_schedule_id \
  --deselect tests/integration/test_router_registration.py::TestRoutePrefixes::test_all_routes_under_api \
  --deselect tests/unit/test_ffmpeg_execution.py::TestExecutionSafety::test_validates_output_path_writable \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_trace_id_appears_in_log_line \
  --deselect tests/routers/test_observability_middleware.py::TestTraceIdMiddleware::test_generated_trace_id_matches_uuidv4_format_in_logs \
  -p no:cacheprovider --tb=line -q

# FE — from host (ecm-ecm-1 has no Node tooling)
cd frontend && npx vitest run --reporter=default
```

Remove the relevant `--deselect` once a flake/drift bead closes.
